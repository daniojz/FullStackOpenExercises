note over browser:
the browser runs the function 
that dynamically renders the note 
list elements
end note

note over browser:
The user add a new note (click on button save) 
and the browser starts the "onsubmit" event. 

The function assigned to this event first prevents
the default onsubmit actions, then gets the value of
the first "input" element of the form and creates a new real
date. Finally adds the note to the notes array, emptys the
form input element, redraws notes dynamically
(redrawNotes()) and sends the new note to the
server (sendToServer(note))
end note

note over browser:
browser executes a console.log() with
the text response. All this without refresh the page ;)
end note
